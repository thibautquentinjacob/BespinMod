Bespin Qt widget style, KWin decoration and stuff

Requirements:
=============
In order to compile you'll need at least
- A c++ compiler, GCC is strongly suggested
- Qt4.3 modules Core, Gui (and DBus on supporting systems) on OSX, Windows or X11 (alphabetical order...)

Linux/X11 Packages: (the actual names may differ, watch out for version numbers)
--------------------
° libX11 (you have...)
° libX11-dev
° libQt4 (...probably...)
° libQt4-dev
° [libXRender] (...this as well)
° [libXRender-dev]
(XRender is not really required, but a little more performant and you definitivey want it in combination with the KWin deco)

If you want the KWin decoration or the XBar plasmoid (mac-a-like menubar)
- cmake >= 2.4
- KDE4

Packages:
---------
° kdelibs (likely...)
° kdelibs-dev
° kdebase (...you already have these)
° kdebase-dev
° libplasma [only if this isn't included in kdebase...]
° libplasma-dev [...resp. kdebase-dev anyway]




Installation Instructions
=========================

-- Content ----------------
a) YOU HAVE CMAKE
b) YOU DON'T HAVE CMAKE
c) YOU WANT A .DEB PACKAGE (-> ./builddeb.sh)
d) YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
e) YOU STILL HAVE TROUBLE

----------------------------

a) YOU HAVE CMAKE ==============================================================================

You just do pretty much the common cmake stuff (described is the interactive easy-to-go way,
using Bash - most shells will work very much similar)

1.  Enter the Bespin source dir (assuming "bespin", might be "cloudcity" - it contains this file)
cd bespin
   2. Make a build subdir
mkdir build
   3. Enter the subdir
cd build
   4. Configure Bespin using ccmake
ccmake ../
      4.1 Press 'c' for a general config run
      4.2 Adjust some paths to your wishes (navigate with the arrow keys, press enter, then type,
          then press enter again)
      4.3 Press 'c' for the final config run
      4.4 Press 'g' to generate makefiles

   5. Run the compiler
make
   6. (finally) Install (as root)
sudo make install

NOTES:
------
- To install using sudo, you'll usually be asked for your root password.
If you don't know it: Ask your admin for help

- You can link steps 5 & 6 by calling:
make && sudo make install
but remember you'll be asked for the root password to install as long as your user isn't permitted
to NOPASSWD in visudo - or you are allready root (i discourage BOTH as permanent setup...)

-----------

b) YOU DON'T HAVE CMAKE =====================================================================

If you don't have cmake (and presumingly no KDE either) you can build the style and the
config application "bespin" using the Qt4 build system.
   1. Make sure you have qmake for Qt 4.x
qmake --version
      If there's an error or qmake operates on Qt3, there may be a Qt4 version outside the $PATH
      Usually it's located in [path_to_your_qt4_installation/bin]
      Windows users: /real/ OSs don't use the backslash '\' to delimit paths... ;-P
   2. Enter the Bespin source dir (assuming "bespin", might be "cloudcity" - it contains this file)
cd bespin
   3. Run qmake (don't forget: Qt4 version ;-)
qmake qmake.pro
   (There's no output in success)
   4. Run the compiler
   make
   5. (finally) Install (as root)
sudo make install

NOTES:
------
- To install using sudo, you'll usually be asked for your root password.
If you don't know it: Ask your admin for help

- You can link steps 4 & 5 by calling:
make && sudo make install
but remember you'll be asked for the root password to install as long as your user isn't permitted
to NOPASSWD in visudo - or you are allready root (i discourage BOTH as permanent setup...)

-----------

c) YOU WANT A .DEB PACKAGE =================================================================

You can directly create debian/ubuntu packages by using the builddep.sh script, which will
create a package named kde-style-bespin that can be installed using the dpkg command.
This requires the debhelper scripts beyound _cmake_ and _all_libs_mentioned_above_ to be installed!

-----------

d) YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ==============================================================

If you don't know anything about your environment or cmake or stuff, you can call the config script
provided with Bespin

   1. Enter the Bespin source dir (assuming "bespin", might be "cloudcity" - it contains this file)
cd bespin
   2. Run configure (and hope for no error messages)
./configure
      (Windows usually has the . in $PATH, anyway - you'll probably rather have to type "configure"
      or ".\configure")
   3. Do NOT leave the current directory (in case you've cmake, it's like "bespin/build")
   4. Run the compiler
make
   5. (finally) Install (as root)
sudo make install
