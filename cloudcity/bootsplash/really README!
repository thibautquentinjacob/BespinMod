This is a simple bootsplash for Bespin (and people who like blue...)

=== GENERATION =============================================================

To generate a splash set for your current framebuffer resolution
just call

./generate.sh

If your framebuffer resolution cannot be detected or you want to generate splashes for other resolutions,
just call

./generate.sh <width>x<height>

e.g. ./generate 1024x768

btw, the silent splash makes a nice wallpaper as well ;)

=== INSTALLATION ============================================================

After you generated the demanded images and configs, it's time too install them.

In general you'll have to be root to do that. The script uses sudo, so
!!! YOU'LL BE ASKED FOR THE SUDO PASSWORD !!!

By default, bootsplashes reside in /etc/bootsplash/themes and that's where we'll install them if you
just call

./generate.sh install

if you however for some very strange reason want to install the splash somewhere else,
you call

./generate.sh install /full/path/to/bootsplashes

=== ACTIVATION ===============================================================

Now the bootsplashes are installed, but not acitaved - afaik the distributions use different mechanisms
to do this, but in general it's like selecting the Bootsplash theme in some system config tool and call

mkinitrd

THE COMMAND MAY DIFFER!

IMPORTANT!
whatever you do and especially if you consider to be a noop and don't know what you're doing:

- DON'T BLAME ME ;)
- CONSULT YOUR DISTRIBUTORS DOCUMENTATION about changing bootsplashes, maybe user groups, try google!
- USE THE DISTRIBUTION FRONTENT - if there's any
- MAKE BACKUPS especially of any "initrd" file in /boot
- STORE THE NAME OF THE BACKUPS - on a piece of PAPER! If you bork anything you can enter the path of the backup'd initrd file in GRUB - LiLo users: you better know what you're doing! ( - and don't forget calling "lilo" before rebooting)
- NO PANIC - if you can't get access to your system anymore, there's still KNOPPIX =)
